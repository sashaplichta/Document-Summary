"Light Therapy and Age-Related Impairments: Can Exposure to a Specific Wavelength of Light Improve Metabolically Demanding Photoreceptors?"
 
This essay discusses research that suggests exposure to a specific wavelength of light may be beneficial in mitigating the aging process 
in metabolically demanding photoreceptors. Results found that rod and cone performance declined after the age of 40, but exposure to a 
670-nm wavelength of light improved the performance of those aged 40 and above. Further research is needed to understand how light 
therapy could potentially benefit other organs and systems.
