It looks like you missed a couple questions. Since most had to do with large language models and neural networks, I'm here to give you a quick overview and help clear up any misunderstanding.


Large language models and neural networks are relatively new artificial intelligence approaches that use deep learning techniques to process natural language in a more efficient way. Some notable examples of these models include Google's BERT, Facebook's RoBERTa and OpenAI's GPT-3. These models use large datasets of text to learn language patterns. To produce results, they employ layers of neural networks that process data in a hierarchical fashion. The models have the ability to better identify nuances in language that made interpreting text with traditional methods more difficult. As a result, this has led to impressive performance in a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, natural language understanding, and conversational AI.
Do you have any questions?
How do they get the data?


The data used for large language models and neural networks comes from various sources such as public datasets, crawled web data, and the data from services that use natural language processing technology, such as search engines or chatbots. Additionally, many of the datasets used to train these models are open source so they can be further modified or extended by developers.
