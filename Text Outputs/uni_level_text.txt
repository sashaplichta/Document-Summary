"Age-related Photoreceptor Decline and the Mitigation of Its Effects with Light Therapy"

Age-related declines in cellular metabolism and photoreceptor function are observed throughout the lifespan. Mitochondria play a 
critical role in this process by providing cells with the necessary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel cellular function. 
Mitochondrial density and activity is greatest in photoreceptors which have high energy demands and is significantly reduced with 
age resulting in a 70% ATP reduction over the life course (1-5). The use of specific wavelengths of light spanning 650-1000nm has 
been found to improve mitochondrial complex activity, membrane potential, and ATP production (6-8). 

In order to assess the impact of light on photoreceptor performance in aging individuals, a psychophysical study was conducted. 
24 healthy participants aged between 28-72 years were included and randomly divided into two groups, younger (age <38) and older 
(age >38). Participants were asked to illuminate their dominant eye with a 670-nm light device for three minutes a day for two weeks. 
Rod and cone performance, as measured by rod thresholds and color contrast sensitivity (CCS), respectively, were recorded post-intervention. 

Results revealed that rod and cone performance significantly declined after the age of 40 years. However, a 670-nm light exposure 
intervention was seen to have no impact on those aged <40 years, while in comparison, a significant improvement in CCS was seen for 
blue visual axis (tritan) in those aged >40 years. Moreover, rod thresholds also improved significantly in those aged >40. 

It is thus evident from the data collected that improvements in mitochondrial function with light therapy may prove beneficial in 
mitigating the aging process in metabolically demanding photoreceptors. Further research is needed to understand the effects of 
optical bio-regulation in other organs and systems throughout the body.
